# xovi extensions for the toolbar


The QMD files in this repo add a quicktools-like floating bar, and a layer management bar. Instructions to install xovi can be found in [here](https://github.com/asivery/rmpp-xovi-extensions/blob/master/INSTALL.MD). After which, copy the files to 
/home/root/xovi/exthome/qt-resource-rebuilder/ and restart xovi. The `Edit.qmd` file adds a trash-can icon to the selection helper, which lets the user delete the stroke selected instead of cutting and clearing the clipboard

These QMDs were tested to work in 3.17. Any bugs should be reported in the repo issues.
